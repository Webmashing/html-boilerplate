# Vertic - Front-end development guidelines

## Friendly guidelines

We're front-end developers. We take wireframes, sketches, mockups and fully fledged designs and ___bring them to life___. That's our job and our responsibility.

More often than not, we're the last people to see, touch and tinker with a design before a project is released to the users. So, remember that:

* The design is your friend. Make sure that it shines.
* The UI Designer is your friend. Show them your work regularly, talk about changes and challenges. Tell them if they're using a gazillion different font-sizes and yuo'd like to change it. Bring them a croissant. 
* The UX Designer is your friend. Show them your work regularly, get their thoughts about transitions and animations, feel and responsiveness. Show them your nifty CSS transitions and let them know, when it only works in Webkit. Have a coffee with them. 
* The Project Manager is your friend. Help them understand what makes your work easy, and what doesn't. Give them updates on your progress. Sometimes they bring candy.
* Do great work. Be proud of it.
